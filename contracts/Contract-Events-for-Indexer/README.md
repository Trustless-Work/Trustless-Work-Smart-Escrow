# Spike 1 Findings: Adding Soroban Events

## Overview

This spike focused on implementing comprehensive Soroban events for the Trustless Work Smart Escrow contract to enable better indexing and monitoring capabilities. The implementation adds structured events for all major contract operations including escrow creation, funding, milestone management, dispute handling, and fund releases.

## Findings

- For each function that published an event, I needed to call a separate helper function to retrieve the current escrow state.
- Testing event publishing requires generating a contract ID.

## Assumptions

- **Soroban SDK Compatibility**: Events use standard Soroban SDK event publishing methods
- **Data Type Compatibility**: All event data types (Address, i128, String) are compatible with Soroban events
- **Event Ordering**: Events are emitted after successful state changes to ensure consistency
- **Gas Efficiency**: Event data is optimized to minimize gas costs while providing necessary context
- **Indexer Compatibility**: Event structure follows Soroban indexing best practices

## Recommendations

- **Add Error Event Handling**: Implement events for failed operations to help with debugging and monitoring
- **Event Validation**: Add tests specifically for event data structure and content validation
- **Event Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for indexers on event structure and data types
- **Event Versioning**: Consider adding event versioning for future contract upgrades
- **Event Filtering**: Implement event filtering capabilities for different use cases
