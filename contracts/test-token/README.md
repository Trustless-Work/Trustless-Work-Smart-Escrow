# Test Token Contract

This crate contains a simplified token contract **intended exclusively for local and unit testing purposes** within the project.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This contract is **not designed for production use**. It exists solely to simulate token behavior for testing the escrow and other core contracts.

## Purpose

- Helps test escrow functionality that depends on token interactions
- Allows controlled and isolated test scenarios
- Keeps production contract logic clean and modular

## Notes

- Do not deploy this contract in production environments
- Maintainers may extend or modify this crate as needed for future test utilities
